    <h4>Experiences</h4>
    <div class="blog1">
        <p><h5>The Dream Visit</h5>
            <h6><i>Published by Aishwarya Iyengar</i> </h6>
            <h7><i><br>April 20th 2019</i></h7>
            I recently visited Taj Mahal to witness it’s beauty in the backdrop of sunset. 
            The much awaited wonder of the world that I always wanted to visit! I am sure I don’t need to explain the history of this place,
            though I got a wonderful guide who was so patriotic about the Taj Mahal as he was a lineage of people who built it.
            The way he explained each and every detail was overwhelming and I literally got goosebumps.
            </p></div>
            <div class="blog2">
                <p><h5>Mixed Feelings</h5>
                    <h6><i>Published by Reena Thomas</i> </h6>

                    Sikkim is a beautiful place. People of Sikkim are simpletons who will love others.
                    They are law abiding people. They will never cheat you. We will feel agony ,when we go to Nathula and compares the facilities {dress and all}given to Our Soldiers and Chinese Soldiers
                    we will feel ashamed and will begin to hate the political executive who remembers them during war time alone. You can see Kangchen junga.
                    They have good botanical garden,beautiful landscapes, buddhist monasteries.clean surroundings, Teesta, lakes etc..I love to visit again</p></div>

                            Varanasi, the oldest town of the world is a legendary pilgrimage where life and death occurs simultaneously. 
                            As the holy water of Ganges is the lifeline of the city, Varanasi rejuvenates the tired souls. Some of the reasons why this old city is still amazing are:
                            The worship of the waters- Ganga Aarti
                             Reach the Ashwamedha Ghat by sunset to check out the grand aarti.
                             The aura of the floating ‘diyas,’ which are the symbols of desires and prayers, create a celestial atmosphere.
                              You can spend the whole evening resting at the banks of the River Ganges, without feeling lonely or bored. 
                              The fire, puja and dance during the worship of the River Ganges unfold the ancient rituals of Hinduism. </p></div>

                                    The Omkareshwa & Mamleshwar (They are 2 Jyotirlings) is situated on a very beautiful island (island having the shape of “OM” if you see from a bird eye view) on the shore of Narmada river(Cleanest and purest river of India). Omkarshwar is in Khandwa district of Madhya Pradesh which is about 70 Kilometer from Indore with fabulous connectivity from Indore and Khandwa both. The visiting to Omakareshwar is very beautiful in all season but it is most beautiful in Saavan/Shravan (first month of the rainy season in India) Narmada river in makes it more charming in the rainy season, There are various festivals celebrated across the rainy season the best part is Shri Omkareshwar Nagar Bhraman(There will be total 5 visits on Shri Omkareshwar in the town on each Monday only) and Maa Narmada Chunar festival Program is adventures along with swimming competition and Matki fod (Break) in the mid of the Narmada river. These are the special festivals in Rainy season apart from that Ganga Dashera and all Purnima and Amavasya are among the important days of Shri Omkareshwar.
